# DecentraSafe

## Overview
**DecentraSafe** is a decentralized, censorship-resistant storage platform for software projects. Built using **Walrus** technology on the **Sui** network, DecentraSafe ensures that projects remain secure, tamper-proof, and accessible without the risk of centralized control or censorship. This project is aimed at democratizing project storage, allowing developers to retain full control over their work.

## Key Features
- **Censorship-Resistant**: Protects projects from being taken down or restricted by central authorities.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Built on Walrus technology to distribute data across a global node network.
- **Tamper-Proof**: Utilizes blockchain immutability.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Designed for developers, offering easy integration and usage without compromising on performance.

## Problem Statement
Centralized platforms like DockerHub and GitHub face increasing pressure to censor or restrict access to certain software projects. This creates a risk for developers who rely on these platforms to store and share their work. The growing trend of centralization introduces vulnerabilities, where political, social, or legal factors may lead to the loss of control over projects.

---

## Solution
DecentraSafe offers a decentralized alternative to centralized storage systems. By leveraging **Walrus** technology and the **Sui** blockchain, it breaks projects into encrypted chunks, storing them across a global network of nodes. This ensures projects are always accessible, secure, and free from any centralized authority's control. Developers can upload, retrieve, and manage their projects without worrying about censorship or data tampering.

---

## How It Works
1. **Decentralization**: Projects are broken into encrypted data chunks using Walrus and stored across various nodes on the Sui network.
2. **Immutability**: The use of blockchain technology ensures that once a project is stored, it cannot be altered or removed without the ownerâ€™s consent.
3. **Access**: Developers can upload and retrieve their projects through DecentraSafe's easy-to-use interface, with all storage being distributed and tamper-proof.
